### About this Course

Apache Spark is one of the most widely used technologies in big data analytics. In this course, you will learn how to leverage your existing SQL skills to start working with Spark immediately. You will also learn how to work with Delta Lake, a highly performant, open-source storage layer that brings reliability to data lakes. By the end of this course, you will be able to use Spark SQL and Delta Lake to ingest, transform, and query data to extract valuable insights that can be shared with your team.

The following are the the two core objectives of the course

* Ingest, transform, and query data to extract valuable insights.

* Leverage existing SQL skills to start working with Apache Spark. 

The course is organized as follows
